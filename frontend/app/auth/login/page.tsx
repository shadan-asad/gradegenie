// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and"
// without declaring or importing them.  Without the original code, I can only provide
// a placeholder fix by declaring these variables.  A proper fix would involve
// identifying the intended source of these variables (e.g., a library import) and
// adding the appropriate import statement.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null
const it = null
const is = null
const correct = null
const and = null

// Assuming the rest of the original code follows here.  Since it was omitted,
// I cannot provide a complete, runnable file.  This is just a placeholder.

function LoginPage() {
  // Example usage of the declared variables (replace with actual usage from original code)
  console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)

      {/* Rest of the login page content */}
