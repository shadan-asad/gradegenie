// No code provided to merge. Assuming the existing code is correct and the updates are errors.
// The updates indicate undeclared variables: brevity, it, is, correct, and and.
// Without the original code, it's impossible to determine the correct fix.
// Possible solutions include:
// 1. Importing the variables from a module.
// 2. Declaring the variables locally.
// 3. Removing the variables if they are not needed.
// Since I don't have the original code, I cannot provide a merged version.
// If the original code is provided, I can attempt to merge the updates.
